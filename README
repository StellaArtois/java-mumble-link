Java Mumble Link

This is a JNI library to talk to the Mumble Link plugin.

You can find the Mumble project at:
http://mumble.info

Note:
A similar library exists inside the mod_mumblelink project at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/modmumblelink/
and
https://github.com/TheSkorm/mod_mumblelink
(Though it was not consulted while this library was being developed, I thought
it was worth mentioning.)
